# Changelog

All notable changes to `skharness` are documented here.

Format: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
Versioning: [SemVer](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). The git tag IS the
version (setuptools-scm); a release is cut by pushing a `v*` tag, or by
dispatching `publish.yml` on `main`, which cuts the next patch tag itself.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `secret-scan` CI gate running the **gitleaks binary** over the full history.

## [0.3.14] - 2026-08-14

### Added
- **Cross-run failure memory (read half + call sites).** Closes the loop opened
  by `skcoord` 0.1.5.

  `engineering.py` threads in-run feedback round to round, but that state died
  when `run()` returned, and `direct.py` hardcoded `prior_feedback=None`. A
  fresh run on a previously-failed card therefore walked in blind.

  - `autocode/failure_memory.py` (new). `build_prior_feedback(item.payload)`
    renders the card's memory as bounded context or `None`: dedup on
    `(outcome, why_failed)` keeping newest, last **3** distinct by `ts`, one
    consequence line each, block hard-capped at **600 chars** with the oldest
    dropped first. Tolerant reader, so a card with no `meta` returns `None`,
    byte-identical to the previous fresh-start behaviour.
    `distill_failure()` reduces grader notes to the failing test id and
    assertion; traceback bulk stays in the run journal.
  - `engineering.py` records at the **two real terminal returns** (the no-op
    double-empty bail and did-not-converge) and seeds round 1 from the card.
  - `direct.py` records `direct_fail` and seeds `prior_feedback` from the card.
  - `finalize()` clears the card on a pass and archives the entries to the run
    journal, so a flaky-CI false failure haunts a card at most until its next
    pass.
  - `journal.py` gains `RunHandle.archive_attempts()`, which deliberately does
    not touch `state` (the orchestrator owns that field and writes it after
    `finalize` returns).

  **Two sites deliberately do NOT record**, each pinned by a regression test:
  `escalate()`, which the orchestrator calls for *every* non-passed result (a
  write there double-counts every failure), and the salvage return, which has
  `passed=False` but opened a CI-green human-review PR: that is a success, and
  recording it would poison future context.

  Every write site is best-effort with `health.record` on failure. Failure
  memory is an optimization and must never be the reason a build dies; tests
  cover a board that raises and a board lacking the method entirely.

  Spec: `docs/specs/2026-08-14-skharness-failure-memory.md`.
  Tests: 40 new cases, including a cross-repo round trip against a real
  `Board` and run journal.

- **CI test gate (`ci.yml`).** Until this existed, every PR check on this repo
  was GitGuardian, a secret scanner: the suite existed and nothing ran it, in
  the repo that owns the autopilot twin gate.
  - `lint` (blocking; nine pre-existing violations fixed to make it so)
  - `test` (3.12, real siblings installed from git main, full suite)
  - `compat-3-10` (proves the declared `requires-python` floor still imports;
    the full suite cannot run there because sibling `skos` is >=3.12)
  - `build` (sdist/wheel + `twine check`)

  The `test` job **fails the build if the cross-repo round trip skips**. Those
  tests self-skip when the sibling is missing, which is right on a dev box and
  wrong in CI, where running them is the entire point.

### Fixed
- **`pypi-publish` was skipped on every tag push, so releases published
  nothing.** GitHub propagates a skip *through* a job: `tag` is skipped on the
  tag-push path, `build` survived via `always()`, but a bare `needs: build` on
  `pypi-publish` still evaluated to skipped because an ancestor was. The build
  was green, the run reported success, and nothing was uploaded. **v0.3.13 was
  lost to this** (the tag was later deleted; PyPI went 0.3.12 → 0.3.14).
- Two test modules hard-imported optional siblings (`skos`, `capauth`) at module
  level, so their absence was a **collection error that took the whole suite
  down** in any clean environment. Both now guard with `pytest.importorskip`.

## [0.3.13] - 2026-08-14 [YANKED]

Tagged but **never published**: see the `pypi-publish` fix above. The tag was
deleted so the git tags match PyPI again.

## [0.3.12] and earlier

Not retrofitted. See `git log` and the release tags.
